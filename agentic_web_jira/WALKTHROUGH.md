## 💡 Pro Tips
- **Confluence Auth**: The scraper uses your Jira credentials automatically to fetch restricted Confluence pages.
- **Dark Mode**: The UI is designed to look premium in BOTH Light and Dark themes of Streamlit.
- **Docker Logs**: Logs are streamed to System Out, so you can watch progress in your terminal using `docker logs -f agentic-jira-app`.

## 🚑 Troubleshooting
- **White text?**: I've fixed the CSS! Just refresh your browser.
- **Can't connect?**: Ensure Your Jira API Token is active and your Ollama server is running on the specified port.
- **Network Error (Docker)**: If Ollama is on your host machine, use `http://host.docker.internal:12434/v1` as the Base URL.
